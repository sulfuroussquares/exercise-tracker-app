#### Exercise Tracker App

This project is intended to facilitate my learning and understanding of various technologies and concepts. It involves the use of:

 - React.js (front-end)
 - MongoDB (nosql database)
 - MongoDB Atlas (cloud-based centralized management for MongoDB data)
 - Mongoose (simplifies interacting with mongodb)
 - Node.js (run JavaScript outside of a browser/package management/back-end services)
 - Express.js (Web Application Framework)

Credit goes to FreeCodeCamp as I coded along their tutorial. Comments have been added throughout the code to explain functionality, and the general process is broken down in this readme.

---
### Database
The db schema is created using Mongoose.
There are two entities: *exercises* and *users*.


--- 
### Testing
We use *Insomnia* to test the server API. This functions similarly to *postman*.
