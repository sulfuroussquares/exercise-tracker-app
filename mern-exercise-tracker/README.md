### Exercise Tracker App

This project involves the use of:

 - React.js (front-end)
 - MongoDB (nosql database)
 - MongoDB Atlas (cloud-based centralized management for MongoDB data)
 - Mongoose (simplifies interacting with mongodb)
 - Node.js (run JavaScript outside of a browser/package management/back-end services)
 - Express.js (Web Application Framework)

Credit goes to FreeCodeCamp as I coded along their tutorial.
