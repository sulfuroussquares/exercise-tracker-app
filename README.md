Mongoose: Schema-based solution to model application data

---
MongoDB uses unique terminology and operates differently from a standard SQL-ish relational database.
- Documents are stored as BSON (Binary JSON)
- Fields are commonly nested (i.e. an "Address attribute may have sub-components). Data that belongs together is stored together.
- Similarly, arrays may be stored within documents
